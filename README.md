### Cab-Booking-System ###
The project consisted of creating an application using Java language. The working environment consisted of NetBeans and the JDBC used to connect the application to the database of drivers and users of the app was SQLite. The application consists of a login page, through which, one can go to a sign up page as well in order to create a new user for applying for a cab. A database of drivers and their original locations were filled and are constant. After logging in, the rider has an option to book a cab, or send money to his driving wallet. Cab fare is decided based on the distance between the two locations that the rider sets. This app also supports multi-threading, that is, two or more riders can book a cab at once. The source code written displays concepts of OOP such as inheritence, encapsulation etc.
